      "title": "LLRF System Analysis for the Fermilab PIP-II Superconducting LINAC",
      "type": "Oral",
      "description": "PIP-II is a superconducting linac that is in the initial acceleration chain for the Fermilab accelerator complex. The RF system consists of a warm front-end with  an RFQ and buncher cavities along with 25 superconducting cryo-modules comprised of cavities with five different acceleration β. The LLRF system for the linac has to provide field and resonance control for a total of 125 RF cavities. Various components of the LLRF system have been tested with  and without beam at the PIP-II test stands. The LLRF system design is derived from the LCLS-II project with its self-excited loop architecture used in the majority of the cryo-modules. The PIP-II beam loading at 2 mA is much higher than LCLS-II linac. The control system architecture is analyzed and evaluated for the operational limits of feedback gains and their ability to meet the project regulation requirements for cavity field amplitude and phase regulation.",

      "description": "The 3 ms long RF pulse at ESS will make Lorentz force detuning (LFD) significant for the superconductive cavities and at 14 Hz repetition rate some ringing might still be present at the start of the next pulse. An iterative compensation algorithm have been developed to reduce the required overhead to maintain a constant cavity field. It is based on detuning calculation of each pulse and provides a voltage to the Piezo stack to counteract LFD. Design details and initial results will be presented.",

      "type": "Oral",
      "description": "Various digital low-level radiofrequency (LLRF) systems are now operating for the Advanced Photon Source Upgrade (APS-U).  This includes a passive superconducting bunch-lengthening cavity LLRF system primarily used for quench detection and signal monitoring of both the cavity and beam.  The original analog-based LLRF systems for the klystron-driven main accelerating cavities were kept intact.  However, a digital 60-Hz-harmonic-related rf noise suppression (RFNS) system was added to suppress noise from the megawatt-class klystrons which leads to beam motion.  Additionally, within the injectors, the Particle Accumulator Ring was upgraded to digital LLRF for improved control.  This report summarizes the systems and shares operational experience with beam.\r\n\r\n* Work supported by U. S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, under Contract No. DE-AC02-06CH11357",

      "description": "As the use of SRF cavities continuously increases at CERN, testing facilities are also being upgraded. Due to the variety of operating frequencies, ranging from 400 MHz to 1.3 GHz, a generic cavity controller has been designed implementing Generator Driven (GD) and Self-Excited Loop (SEL) modes. A modern approach for separating gateware, embedded firmware (micro-controller unit) and low-level software, as well as Continuous Integration (CI) for automatic bitstream generation and simulation have been used in the Universal Cavity Controller (UCC). Additionally, the UCC development is planned to be applied in MicroTCA architecture in the framework of a project for axion detection using a SRF cavity.",

      "description": "The SEL architecture used commonly in  CW superconducting linacs is a positive feedback system that requires determining the correct limits for the operating conditions to ensure stable operation. These limits are determined from the results of the amplifier calibration which characterizes the  dac drive(forward power) against the cavity field. When the amplifier non-linearity precludes a simple linear fit for this characteristic, its modification to account for the amplifiers non-linearity is essential to operate the system in the SEL architecture. This process is described with test data from a 32kW SSA for the PIP-II linac.",

      "description": "The digital low level RF systems that are used to operate 17 of the 53 cryomodules that are installed in CEBAF have the capability to log 17 waveforms either on demand or when one of the cavities in the cryomodules trips off. In 2018, the software and hardware in the digital low-level RF systems was configured such that a fault would trigger an acquisition process to record 17 RF waveform signals for each of the 8 cavities within the cryomodule for subsequent analysis. To date approximately 15,000 faults have been analyzed.  This contribution will describe the types of faults encountered during operation and their signatures in the time domain data, as well as how it is being used to modify the setup of the machine and implement improvements to the cryomodules.",

      "type": "Oral",
      "description": "With the talk, we present recent developments of the high-power microwave components with their applications for SRF accelerators. The first example is the Ferroelectric Fast Reactive Tuner (FE-FRT) developed by Euclid in collaboration with FNAL and BNL, and successfully tested at CERN. This technique has now become practically feasible due to the recent development of a new extremely low loss and fast (10 ns-100 ns time range) ferroelectric material, which has been tested, and fast frequency tuning has been demonstrated. The Horizon Europe iSAS project focuses on improving accelerator efficiency and includes the integration of a ferroelectric fast reactive tuner (FE-FRT) to enhance energy conservation. Applications under this initiative include  transient beam loading and microphonic compensation. In the U.S., FE-FRT technology is under active development for microphonics compensation in CEBAF by the DOE SBIR 2025 project.  In the initial part of the project, an RF model of a 3-stub tuner with the ferroelectric section are being fabricated to be tested at Jlab. Control System and LLRF model of integration of the ferroelectric based three-stub tuner into the CEBAF cryomodule is under development.",

      "description": "The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) was fully commissioned in 2021 and began user operations in May 2022. This talk provides an update on Low-Level Radio Frequency (LLRF) system activities at FRIB during the transition from commissioning to routine operation. Key efforts have focused on spare parts management and the development of advanced troubleshooting tools to support reliable system performance. We present operational insights from the early stages, including achieved performance metrics, system uptime, lessons learned, automation of cavity turn-on/off, conditioning, auto-restart process and beam based feedback for LLRF energy and phase regulation. Additionally, we briefly introduce ongoing developments of a new LLRF hardware platform designed to support future FRIB upgrade cavities.\r\n\r\nThis material is based upon work supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Nuclear Physics and used resources of the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams Operations, which is a DOE Office of Science User Facility under Award Number DE-SC0023633.",

      "description": "One easily overlooked component of Low-Level Radio Frequency (LLRF) design is the commissioning of new system installations.  During Jefferson Lab’s (JLab) 2024 Scheduled Accelerator Maintenance (SAM), two CEBAF zones were upgraded with C75 Cryomodules and JLab’s LLRF 3.0 system.  JLab’s team has invested heavily in the automation and standardization of their commissioning process.  Several key components of this process include verification of the interlocks, klystron characterization and cavity characterization.  This poster will present a summary of LLRF commissioning at JLab.",

Commissioning of the subsystems for the Mu2e experiment is starting this year.The RF components for this system are located at large distances from the LLRF controller. 2.5 MHz beam bunches from the Recycler are transferred to the delivery ring into 2.36 MHz buckets for resonant extraction to the Mu2e beamline. The LLRF hardware is being upgraded to a larger FPGA board and additional  functions such as the drivers for the AC dipole extinction magnets are being added to the system. A local FPGA controller chassis is being used to digitize the cavity signals and to co-ordinate the beam transfer manipulations. The system architecture is described and the results of the initial\r\ntesting presented.",

This involves removing and installing new equipment related to the sources, injectors, low energy beam transport (LEBT), radio-frequency quadrupole (RFQ), medium energy beam transport (MEBT) and the drift-tube linac (DTL). Additionally, a test accelerator will be built to demonstrate the proof of concept for the new systems before removing the front-end of LANSCE.

This equips the legacy zones with both real time waveforms of key cavity control signals as well as the ability to trigger when beam is lost in the machine. This poster will help track ongoing efforts related to these fast DAQs as well as some problems that were encountered along the way.",

      "description": "The Proton Synchrotron (PS), CERN’s first synchrotron, delivers proton and ion beams with intensities covering almost four orders of magnitude using 25 RF cavities with frequencies ranging from 0.4 to 200 MHz. The LLRF system includes multi-harmonic feedback loops to control the field in the cavities and beam-based loops to perform complex beam manipulations. The current beam control system is implemented using a mix of analog and digital hardware, suffering from obsolescence and reproducibility issues. The new fully digital system, implemented in VMEbus Switched Serial (VXS) and MicroTCA platforms, is currently in its initial commissioning phase. This work presents a complete description of the new beam control system as well as the first results of the initial commissioning phase in the machine.",

The LLRF systems for these were the first ones developed more than a decade ago for use at the test stands. Some were VXI crate based and others used early generation FPGA boards that are light in resources. These LLRF systems and the one for the first superconducting cryomodule, the HWR will be upraded with the ARRIA10 SOCFPGA chassis with EPICS interfaces like the rest of the PIP-II Linac. The RFQ and the HWR have unique resonance control systems which are integrated into the LLRF controller hardware. The results of the initial testing with a cavity emulator will be presented.",

      "type": "Poster",
      "description": "The TEX (Test-stand for X-band) facility at LNF-INFN was established in 2021 and commissioned in 2022. It serves as an R&D center for X-band technology, supporting activities from waveguide component design and high-power testing to low-level RF (LLRF) system development. TEX is equipped with a 50 MW X-band klystron (CPI, USA) powered by a K400 solid-state modulator (ScandiNova, Sweden), operating at a 50 Hz repetition rate. It was recently upgraded with two additional RF high-power sources: a 25 MW, 400 Hz X-band unit and a 20 MW, 400 Hz C-band unit, both manufactured by Canon. This upgrade required a complete redesign of the X-band LLRF system, now featuring: (i) three C-band Libera LLRF systems (Instrumentation Technologies, Slovenia); (ii) an up/down converter, for frequency translation to the European X-band (11.994 GHz); (iii) a reference distribution system, for coherent frequency reference delivery across all the facility sub-systems. The whole LLRF system has been successfully designed, tested and installed at TEX in spring 2025. We report here the first experimental results from low power commissioning started in June 2025.",

      "description": "The Electron Ion Collider is an exciting collaborative effort to advance and invest in the future of nuclear physics and accelerator science. Part of this great effort includes designing a diverse set of RF cavities and control systems, in which heterodyning still plays a fundamental role. There are multiple frequencies in the VHF and UHF bands which require up and/or down conversion, and designing one circuit board that can accommodate local oscillator signals for multiple mixing schemes was a valuable and interesting task. A combinatorics problem emerged out of this component’s constraints that required organizing a large number of cases and integrating commercial data to reveal the best design choices. Pictures of the prototypes and their performance are displayed to demonstrate its success. This poster showcases only part of the vast and impressive collaboration between Brookhaven National Laboratory and the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility.",

This upgrade includes the addition of 184 high-energy (HE) SRF cavities operating at an average gradient of 22 MV/m, supplementing the 280 existing LCLS-II SRF cavities. To support these new cavities, the HE LLRF project will deploy 46 LLRF rack systems to provide precise RF field regulation—meeting amplitude and phase stability requirements of 0.01% and 0.01° RMS, and resonance control to maintain average cavity detuning below 1 Hz. This paper presents an overview of the HE LLRF project status, reviews system updates, and discusses readiness for the upcoming LLRF installation and checkout, along with key lessons learned throughout the project lifecycle.",

      "description": "The PAL-XFEL LLRF and SSA systems have contributed to the stable operation of PAL-XFEL for nearly a decade with their reliability and robustness. Key achievements of these systems include the development of pulse-by-pulse real-time RF switching function for simultaneous operation of the HX and SX beamlines, development of a converter-type X-band LLRF, and development of a function to improve RF amplitude drift. The systems have faced various challenges during their operation, such as the arrival of key component life cycles, the discontinuation of key components, and the need for upgrades to keep pace with technological advances. Therefore, the following activities are being pursued. The PAL-XFEL LLRF and SSA systems have been field-proven, so upgrades are being carried out based on the existing systems. The discontinued processing PCs have been upgraded to higher-performance industrial boards, the RF modules are being redeveloped, and the A/D and FPGA boards are planned to be upgraded with new FPGAs and PCIe. In addition, an updated SSA prototype has been developed.",

      "type": "Poster",
      "description": "The Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) is a long-term project to design and construct a facility to collide high energy polarized electron beams with polarized proton and heavy ion beams at center of mass energies from 20 to 140 GeV with luminosity up to 1034 cm-2s-1. This facility will be built on top of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), Brookhaven National Laboratory’s current operational high energy collider. In order to achieve the high luminosity outlined in the EIC’s design, Crab Cavities will be used around Interaction Points to correct for geometric effects due to crossing angles. These cavities have extremely strict phase noise requirements that are challenging to achieve (< -151 dBc/Hz at a 10 kHz offset from a 197 MHz Carrier). In order to meet these requirements, a low noise 2 GHz clock was designed using a 100 MHz OCXO. The 100 MHz OCXO was then locked to a separate low noise 100 MHz clock using an analog PLL to further reduce close in phase noise. This clock was then used with a low noise DAC (AD9164) to generate an RF drive signal at various frequencies of interest.",

      "description": "In the Hard X-ray Free Electron Laser (SHINE), the normal-conducting L-band buncher is critical for compressing electron bunches, significantly improving beam quality to meet stringent low-emittance and low-energy-spread injection requirements. Due to its 2-cell structure, a digital LLRF control system which based on an FPGA and RF front-end architecture using I/Q demodulation was designed. This system implements amplitude/phase feedback, frequency tuning, and multi-motor coordination for field flatness control. During 10kW continuous-wave (CW) operation the amplitude stability (peak-to-peak) improved from ±0.17% in open-loop to within ±0.03% under closed-loop, while the phase stability (peak-to-peak) was controlled within ±0.05°,and field flatness was maintained within ±2%, fully meeting design specifications. This achievement is critical for ensuring high-stability accelerator operation.",

      "description": "The PIP-II linac is an international collaboration project with in kind contributions of key subsystems from multiple countires including India(DAE).  In the research and development phase of the project, the LLRF and resonance control systems were jointly developed by BARC and Fermilab and were delivered to Fermilab for testing and validation. Initial testing of the LLRF system was carried out using Fermilab’s analog cavity emulator. Following successful emulator testing, the LLRF system was deployed at STC on a PIP-II 325 MHz SSR2 cavity. The cavity was operated in both SEL and GDR modes at a gradient of 5 MV/m. The results of the testing are presented here.",

      "description": "The Electron Ion Collider project is a large and exciting effort within the accelerator community. There will be 8 different styles of Cryomodule and as many varied styles of normal conducting cavities. All of these modules require interlock protection and most require some form of resonance control. This abstract presents the ongoing efforts at Jefferson Lab to develop a modular system which can scale in accordance to a cavities resonance and interlock control needs; thereby reducing the number of different styles of resonance and interlocks control chassis required and consolidates the interface controls to one common system. The immediate benefit is reduced cost in manufacturing and the long term benefit will be in simplified support for common shared spares.",

      "description": "The EIC Common Platform is a modular system architecture which will serve as the basis for EIC Accelerator Controls. It consists of an SoC-based carrier board with up to two independent pluggable FPGA-based Daughtercards. Different types of Daughtercards have custom electronics catering to the specific needs of an application. Daughtercards will have FPGA logic to support a common protocol for communication with the carrier board as well as a basic set of features for programming and telemetry. RF Controls applications will use two versions of an RF Digitizer Daughtercard designed by the LLRF team as well as several of the general purpose Daughtercards designed in collaboration by the LLRF, Accelerator Controls, and Instrumentation groups. The system architectures for various LLRF applications using the Common Platform components will be presented.",

      "title": "Comparative Evaluation of Xilinx RFSoC Platform for Low-Level RF Systems",
      "type": "Poster",
      "description": "The rapid advancement of Radio Frequency System-on-Chip (RFSoC) technology from Xilinx (AMD) has enabled the integration of high-speed data converters and programmable logic within a single package. RFSoC platforms are already widely adopted in telecommunications, radar, and satellite communications, where they promise reductions in system footprint and power consumption. However, their suitability for Low-Level RF (LLRF) control systems in accelerator environments—where stability requirements are critical—has not been quantitatively evaluated. This paper presents a comparative measurement-based assessment of RFSoC-based and conventional LLRF designs, focusing on signal fidelity, phase noise, latency, system complexity, and integration challenges. The advantages and challenges of adopting RFSoC-based direct conversion architectures are discussed, providing guidance for future LLRF system implementations.",
