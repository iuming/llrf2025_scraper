      "title": "Advanced LLRF Automation and Diagnostic Strategies for Horizontal Testing of HIAF SRF Cavities",
      "type": "Oral",
      "description": "The High Intensity heavy-ion Accelerator Facility (HIAF), currently under construction, will employ a series of superconducting RF (SRF) cavities in its injector linac (iLinac) to accelerate heavy-ion beams. Comprehensive performance validation of each SRF cavity in a horizontal test stand prior to its installation in the accelerator tunnel is a critical prerequisite for the successful commissioning of the iLinac. To this end, we have developed an advanced Low-Level RF (LLRF) automation and diagnostic system for the horizontal test stand of HIAF's low-beta SRF cavities. This system integrates several key functions: high-precision measurement of cavity parameters, automated conditioning at both room and cryogenic temperatures, reliable quench detection, and stable closed-loop operation. The successful application of these advanced strategies not only validates that the cavity performance meets design specifications but also significantly enhances the efficiency and consistency of the testing process, laying a solid foundation for the subsequent installation and commissioning of the HIAF iLinac.",

      "type": "Oral",
      "description": "SELAP (Self Excited Loop Amplitude and Phase) algorithm has been operational at Jefferson Lab for controlling high Q cavities since 2021. Core algorithm of controlling the amplitude and the phase works reliably independent of the environment. When combined with the operational aspects such as high microphonics, mechanical coupling between the cavities, heavy beam loading etc., lot of exception handling had to be added in the gateware and software for making the operation easier and reliable. This poster describes some of the operational aspects noticed and the methodology used for detection and the mitigation.",

This paper demonstrates an open-source, direct sampling RFSoC based LLRF system design, featuring: sample-to-sample Multi-Tile Synchronization, deterministic latency, digital up/down conversion, arbitrary waveform generation and acquisition, in-pulse closed loop control, timing and EPICS integration, modular RF frontend and hardware designs. Measured RF characteristics show that the RFSoC LLRF system is able to meet the system requirement.",
